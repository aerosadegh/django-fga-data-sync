**Django Authz Data Sync** is a declarative, Outbox-pattern OpenFGA synchronizer for Django models.

This package automatically translates your Django relational models into OpenFGA authorization graph tuples. It guarantees perfect, highly-available synchronization between your local PostgreSQL database and your distributed OpenFGA server using the **Transactional Outbox pattern** and **Celery**.

## 🚀 Why use this package?

* ⚡ **Zero-Boilerplate Synchronization:** Write standard Django models, and we handle the distributed FGA network writes automatically in the background.
* 🛡️ **Declarative Security:** Secure your DRF endpoints instantly using simple, declarative dictionary configurations. No more complex permission classes.
* 🔗 **100% Decoupled:** Change your business security rules (e.g., adding a new `viewer` role) without ever deploying new Python code.
* 🏗️ **Clean Architecture Ready:** Designed to work seamlessly with Repository patterns and Service layers, keeping your Django Views pristine and your business logic testable.
